# cloud-init-centos-7.6-ipv6.yml
#
# This one is intended for new instances where:
# * the ENA adapter is in use, for example for the t3 and m5 instance types.
# * you want both IPv4 and IPv6 networking enabled
#
# This has both ens3 and ens5 in it, although only one of these usually appears in practice,
# due to variability people have reported in starting up ena instances when the grub command
# line parameter "net.ifnames=0" is not present.
#
# Partially derived from:
# * pakdel's sketch of a network service remediation script in https://bugs.centos.org/view.php?id=13836
# * ldennison's comment in https://bugs.centos.org/view.php?id=14760 
# * hhsnow's comment in https://bugs.centos.org/view.php?id=14107
# * the cloud-init config in https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-migrate-ipv6.html#vpc-migrate-ipv6-instance-types
#
# Tested on CentOS Linux release 7.6.1810 (Core) and a t3.micro
# instance on 2019-05-19
